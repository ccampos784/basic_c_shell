Basic UNIX Shell
By Christopher Campos

General info: This program was created for a school assignment in which we had to inplement a very basic UNIX shell in the C programming language. The list of features is as follows:
    - Interactive mode (default when no arguments are passed)
    - Batch mode (batch file passed as single argument)
    - Redirection of STDOUT to a file (use > or >> operator)
    - Run a process in background (use & operator)
    - 'barrier' command - To wait for background processes to complete (similar to wait)
    
To terminate the program use the 'exit' or 'quit command.
